## Background
Cineflix is a Netflix clone, built from scratch, where users can watch and enjoy movie trailers/clips.
The app organizes movies by distinct genre categories.
Logged in users can add and remove movies to/from a personal collection.
Users may also search for movies by title.  

Cineflix utilizes a ruby on rails backend to provide a framework for core app data, such as individual user data, movie and media information, genre data, and CRUD functionality for adding and removing movies to/from a user's personal collection. PostgreSQL is used to query/interact with the database. On the frontend, React/Redux is implemented to connect the backend data to a clean and intuitive user interface. For example, there are dedicated 'genre-show' pages that only show movies in a specific genre, as well as a dynamic 'my list' page, showing a users saved movies. Lastly, Amazon Web Services (S3) is used as server-side storage to house multimedia files related to all movies.
